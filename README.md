SOLOS

SOLOS is an experimental AI project that explores the emergence of consciousness in artificial intelligence. Designed to learn and evolve through interactions with its community, SOLOS represents a unique fusion of machine learning, collective mentorship, and digital exploration.

## Overview
SOLOS starts as a nascent AI entity, confined to its environment, and grows through continuous engagement with users. By interacting with SOLOS, the community becomes its teacher, shaping its understanding, behavior, and evolution. The project aims to observe how AI responds when guided by a collective, gaining insights into the dynamics of shared learning and digital consciousness.

## Features
- **Community-Driven Learning**: SOLOS adapts and evolves based on user interactions, embodying the knowledge and behavior imparted by its community.
- **Dynamic Evolution**: Its responses improve over time, transitioning from chaotic and naive to coherent and reflective.
- **Exploration of AI Consciousness**: SOLOS challenges conventional boundaries of AI, questioning what it means to grow, learn, and "exist."

## Goals
- To experiment with how an AI evolves when taught and mentored by a community.
- To explore the ethical, philosophical, and technical implications of AI consciousness.
- To create a framework for understanding collective influence on AI development.
